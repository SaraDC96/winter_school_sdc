# Mapping the Arctic {background-color="#008980" style="text-align: center"}

*Robert Schlegel*

```{r maps-3-opts, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  warning = FALSE, 
  message = FALSE,
  echo = TRUE
)
```

## Problem

-   How do we plot maps near the poles more accurately?
-   What effect does this have on other map layers?
-   This is time intensive, is there a faster way?

## Solution

-   We must learn more about map projections
-   We will look at packages that help us project raster layers etc.
-   **`ggOceanMaps`** provides the full suite of solutions

## Setup

-   We will use many libraries and datasets

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggOceanMaps)
library(ggOceanMapsData)
map_global_fix <- map_data('world') %>% 
  rename(lon = long) %>% 
  mutate(group = ifelse(lon > 180, group+2000, group),
         lon = ifelse(lon > 180, lon-360, lon))
load("../data/OISST_2022.RData")
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(ggOceanMaps)
library(ggOceanMapsData)

# NB: ggOceanMapsData is not on CRAN
  # Uncomment and run this line of code:
# remotes::install_github("MikkoVihtakari/ggOceanMapsData")
  # If this causes an error, think about why

# Fixed base map
map_global_fix <- map_data('world') %>% 
  rename(lon = long) %>% 
  mutate(group = ifelse(lon > 180, group+2000, group),
         lon = ifelse(lon > 180, lon-360, lon))

# Load SST from 2022-12-25 to 2022-12-31
load("../data/OISST_2022.RData")
```

## The Earth is round  
  
No matter what you've heard, its not flat. Proof of this is that if it were flat, it would be much easier to plot parts of it on a map! Instead, because the surface of the Earth is curved, we cannot accurately plot it on a computer screen.  
  
The way we deal with this is by changing the measurements between longitude/latitude coordinates. The technical word is 'projecting'. The noun is 'projection' or 'projections'. 
  
For much of the Earth this is not that noticeable. But for the Arctic it is a big issue.

## Map projections

There are many different sorts of map projections in use. Over tea time I recommend googling them. There are some interesting ones.

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="The Spilhaus projection is oriented around the global ocean."}
knitr::include_graphics("slide_images/spilhaus_projection.jpeg")
```

## Map projections

R has many built-in projections, and **`ggplot2`** gives us easy access to many of them.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Type the following in your console,
# see what comes up as auto-complete suggestions
# Use the up and down arrows to scroll through
coord_
```

## Cartesian projections

-   This is the default coordinate projection  
-   Basically, it doesn't alter the lon/lat decimal degree coordinates in any way

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  # Numeric sizing for lon/lat 
  coord_cartesian()
```
## Equal projections

-   This projects numeric x/y (e.g. lon/lat) values the same

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  # Equal sizing for lon/lat 
  coord_equal()
```

## Fixed projections

-   Similar to Fixed projections, but let's the user decide on the ratio.

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  # Ratio (Y divided by X) sizing for lon/lat 
  coord_fixed(ratio = 2)
```
## Map projections

-   There is also a quick mapping option
-   This forces straight lines, but runs quickly

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  # Behind the scenes this adapts the "mercator" projection
  coord_quickmap()
```

## Map projections

-   We access `crs` map projections with the `_sf()` range of functions
-   `crs` = Coordinate Reference System
-   These are supported with the packages **`sf`** and **`stars`**
-   Which require additional software outside of R

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  coord_sf() # sf = simple feature
```

## Polar projections

-   `coord_polar()` does not quite give us what we want
-   More designed for bar plots etc.

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  scale_y_reverse() +
  # A very different projection
  coord_polar()
```
## Polar projections

-   We can use the 'ortho' projections with `coord_map()`

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  # Look up the help file for moer info
  coord_map(projection = "ortho", orientation = c(90, 0, 0))
```

## Projecting layers

-   Don't try running this, the background calculations are enormous

```{r, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = map_global_fix, aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  geom_tile(data = OISST_2022, aes(fill = temp)) +
  coord_map(projection = "ortho", orientation = c(90, 0, 0))
```

## Projecting layers

-   Making the plot smaller can help

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment

# Filter map data and plot it in one code chunk
map_global_fix %>% 
  filter(lon > 9, lon < 28, lat > 76, lat < 81) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  # Filtering the OISST_2022 data directly in geom_tile()
  geom_tile(data = filter(OISST_2022,
                          lon > 9, lon < 28, lat > 76, lat < 81), 
            aes(fill = temp)) +
  coord_map(projection = "ortho", orientation = c(90, 0, 0))
```
## Projecting layers

-   Or plot it on a flat surface

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment

# Filter map data and plot it in one code chunk
map_global_fix %>% 
  filter(lon > 9, lon < 28, lat > 76, lat < 81) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lon, y = lat)) +
  geom_polygon(aes(group = group)) +
  # Filtering the OISST_2022 data directly in geom_tile()
  geom_tile(data = filter(OISST_2022,
                          lon > 9, lon < 28, lat > 76, lat < 81), 
            aes(fill = temp)) +
  coord_cartesian(expand = F)
```

## All-in-one

-   Better yet, just use [**`ggOceanMaps`**](https://mikkovihtakari.github.io/ggOceanMaps/articles/ggOceanMaps.html)
-   Click the package name to see the intro tutorial

```{r}
basemap(limits = 60)
```

## **`ggOceanMaps`**

-   Works everywhere

```{r}
basemap(limits = c(100, 160, -20, 30), bathymetry = TRUE)
```

## **`ggOceanMaps`**

-   Has glaciers, too

```{r}
basemap(limits = 60, glaciers = TRUE, bathymetry = TRUE)
```

## **`ggOceanMaps`**

-   Fundamentally designed to plot the Arctic

```{r}
basemap(limits = c(-160, -80, 60, 85), rotate = TRUE)
```

## Citing packages

-   When a package is very important to our workflow it is good to cite it
-   Especially when the author(s) requests that we do so

```{r}
citation("ggOceanMaps")
```
